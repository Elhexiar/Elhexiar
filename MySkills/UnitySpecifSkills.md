# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Second Year Small Project :
https://claude-blanchet-babin.itch.io/no-hands-on-deck

I handled :

- Architecture
- Systems
- Interactions
- Collision
- Sound Design
- UI and Inspect Menu
- 1st Door, Computer, Lever&Light Puzzles
- All the animations
- Puzzle sync logic
- All the animations were either made with the animator or with interpolations and curves
- Basically everything except the camera rotation and the main table, and morse puzzle.
