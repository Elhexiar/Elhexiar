## Engine and software flexibility

During my studies as well as my own  game dev journey, i have experienced a multitude of Game Engines and Softwares.
In each one i focus on understanding the systems and principle behind all of them so that i can more easily transition to other similar software if need be.
For engine I have experience in :
- Unreal Engine 5 (BP & C++)
- Unity (C#)
- Godot (GDscript & C++)
- Phaser (Javascript, HTML5, CSS)
- Ren'Py (Python)

I mainly focus on using Unreal and Unity, but i know that a lot of studios have their own propriatry Engine, I'm certain that my will to learn and pattern recognition would greatly help me adapt rapidly to a new engine.

## Knowledge of a wide array of Game Dev Domains

Being taught in a Game Dev School has given me the opportunity to both try and work with a lot of different Game Dev domains.
I always tried to rigorously learn as mush as i could about each of this domains, and have hands on experience.
As such is have experience in :
- Game Design
- Level Design
- 3D Modeling (Environement Art, UV Unwrapping, Rigging, Animation, both Blender and Maya)
- Tech Art (Mainly Shader (Nodal and HLSL) in Unreal and Unity)
- 2D art (Pixel Art, Concept Art, Artistic Direction)
- Naration (Narrative Structure, WorldBuilding)

## Technical Knowlege in Electronics

Prior to my Game Dev studies I was in the Electronics Engineering field following a 2 year University Degree.
As such have done internship in a Medical Lab LTSI Rennes as a Data Analyst.
I have also been a Technician In Avionics Electronic at Sabena Technics for multiple small contracts accross the years
These experience as a technician, helped me understand how to combine rigor with flexibility in my work.

# Language

I am native to France and therfore have a *Navite level in French*.
Furthermore I am *fluent in English* as this document and any conversation we could have can attest.
I do all my work entirely in English unless required otherwise.

I am also currently learning Spanish.

# Soft Skills

## Will to learn new skills, systems and software

I always had a very curious nature in a wide array of domains, although i now tend to focus my curiosity on the Game Dev Field I still like to learn a lot from otherwise completely unrealated topics and domains.

This has helped me in my work adapt more easily to new systems, software and Engine. I am absolutely not afraid to change my habits and always enthusiastic about learning new software and/or Pipeline.

## Rigorous

I was not born rigorous, it was something i had to counciously work toward and in wich i now take pride. I like to have an organised workspace and workflow.
I regularly  review my own work to either catch errors, or find better and more efficient ways to do things.
I also always keep in mind the fact that others have to easily understand my work as i have always lived according to the saying
"Do as you would like others to do"

## Team Player

**TODO REFACTOR**
During my 3 year degree a huge majority of my work was done in groups in which i had to assume different roles everytime.
I understand the dynamics of groups work and how to integrate myself or help other similar to me integrate better.
Having worked with a lot of different people specialized in diferent works, i can understand what they do, and how to make anyone understand my work.
I have experience in being led and leading people, which helps me understand better the different perspective and dynamics of teamwork.

## Creativity

Despite choosing a really carthesian path, i pride myself in having a lot of creativity.
I specificaly chose Game Dev because it was a way to display my programming skills in an artistic field ( obviously also because of my underlying passion for Video Game )
I still draw and practice music, especially Singing and Piano which i practice since childhood.

## Unwavering Passion for Video Games

As far as i can recall I was always passionate about Video Games, but quickly it became more than a simple way to have fun and spend time with friend.
It became a medium through wich i experienced new emotions and stories far more impactfull than in cinema or books.
I quickly got passionate about the underlying processes and history behind my favorite games, listening through Post Mortem conference, and GDC talks.
disecting game mechanics narration and designs.
This Techical and Artistic approach to video games quicly superceded my more casual enjoyment of the medium and drasticaly changed the way i consumed Video Games.
I now make a point to try and explore as much as i can of the vast landscape that video games can offer, and dont think i will ever be able to quench my thirst for interesting game experience !
