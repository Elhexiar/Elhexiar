## Engine and software flexibility

During my studies as well as my own  game dev journey, i have experienced a multitude of Game Engines and Softwares.
In each one i focus on understanding the systems and principle behind all of them so that i can more easily transition to other similar software if need be.
For engine I have experience in :
- Unreal Engine 5 (BP & C++)
- Unity (C#)
- Godot (GDscript & C++)
- Phaser (Javascript, HTML5, CSS)
- Ren'Py (Python)

I mainly focus on using Unreal and Unity, but i know that a lot of studios have their own propriatry Engine, I'm certain that my will to learn and pattern recognition would greatly help me adapt rapidly to a new engine.

## Knowledge of a wide array of Game Dev Domains

Being taught in a Game Dev School has given me the opportunity to both try and work with a lot of different Game Dev domains.
I always tried to rigorously learn as mush as i could about each of this domains, and have hands on experience.
As such is have experience in :
- Game Design
- Level Design
- 3D Modeling (Environement Art, UV Unwrapping, Rigging, Animation, both Blender and Maya)
- Tech Art (Mainly Shader (Nodal and HLSL) in Unreal and Unity)
- 2D art (Pixel Art, Concept Art, Artistic Direction)
- Naration (Narrative Structure, WorldBuilding)

## Technical Knowlege in Electronics

Prior to my Game Dev studies I was in the Electronics Engineering field following a 2 year University Degree.
As such have done internship in a Medical Lab LTSI Rennes as a Data Analyst.
I have also been a Technician In Avionics Electronic at Sabena Technics for multiple small contracts accross the years
These experience as a technician, helped me understand how to combine rigor with flexibility in my work.
