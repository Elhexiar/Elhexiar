## I'm Mathis MIRIEL

I'm a ***Game Programmer*** student finishing my third year at ESMA Rennes, France.
I am also currently looking for either an entry job or an internship.

I was always pationate about video games, and have always dreamed of being part of this industry.
After getting a DUT (two years university degree) in Industrial Electronics, I finaly decided to follow my dream and dedicate my effort fully in becoming a Game Dev.

I then enroled in ESMA Rennes, while continuing in my free time to explore new skills.
I have experience in :

- Unreal (BPs and C++)
- Unity
- WebGames (notably Phaser)

I also have experience in python from working as an intern Data Analyst for LTSI Rennes.

I have experience in **Systems Programming, Gameplay Programming and Tooling**, I also have experience of numerous Unreal Engine Systems and am ready and eager to adapt to any new systems or software thrown at me !

I also put a great emphasis on understanding as much as i can about the different Game Dev Crafts outside of my area of expertise.
I Know the fundamentals in 3D Art (Maya/Blender), 2D Art(Photoshop), Animation (Blender) and especially Level and Game Design on which i still regularly try to improve.

This appetite for knowledge and creativity is also present in my hobbies outside of Game Dev such as Music and especially piano which i practice since my childhood.
